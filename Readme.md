Run Server
----------

  To run the server you just have to execute:
  `$ grunt serverExpress`

Interacting With API
--------------------

  After you have set up the server and executed `$ grunt serverExpress`, you can access **http://localhost:3000** and use
  the interface to test responses and behavior. (This code is in 'serverExpress/public/index.html').

Endpoints Available
-------------------

  * '/users/?q=_query_' - GET - List of all users or search by name using _query_
  * '/users/' - POST - Create user
  * '/users/me' - GET - Get logged user
  * '/users/me' - PUT - Update logged user profile
  * '/users/:userId' - GET - Get user with given ID
  * '/users/:userId' - DELETE - Delete user with given ID
  * '/users/:userId/password' - PUT - Change user's password
  * '/friendships/requested' - GET - Get friendships that logged user requested
  * '/friendships/received' - GET - Get friendships that logged user received
  
  All endpoints are authenticated/authorized, but creating user. This endpoint is public. And the endpoint
  to delete user is authorized only to a admin.
  
Auth
----

  Authorization/Authentication is done using token, by JWT.
  
Test
----

  We are using [mocha](http://mochajs.org/), [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) and 
  [should](https://github.com/shouldjs/should.js) to do Unit Testing. We also added 
  [blanket](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket) as a coverage tool.

  Obs.: Windows users BE WARNED! To execute the grunt test task you need to perform a change in the blanket lib.
  In the file node_modules/blanket/src/index.js (lines 128-134) we have this code:

  ```
   //instrument js files
   require.extensions['.js'] = function(localModule, filename) {
     var pattern = blanket.options("filter"),
         reporter_options = blanket.options("reporter_options"),
         originalFilename = filename,
   		  inputFilename = filename;
     filename = blanket.normalizeBackslashes(filename);
  ```

  Please, kindly change it to:

  ```
   //instrument js files
   require.extensions['.js'] = function(localModule, filename) {
     var pattern = blanket.options("filter"),
         reporter_options = blanket.options("reporter_options"),
         originalFilename = filename,
   			 inputFilename = blanket.normalizeBackslashes(filename);
     filename = inputFilename;

   ```

   Otherwise a exception will explode in the console because of windows path.
